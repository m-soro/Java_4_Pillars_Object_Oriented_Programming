# Four Pillars of OOP

## Part 1 Class

### Represent Employee - Class

1. Create an Employee class
2. **Attributes:** name, age, salary, location
3. **Behavior:** raiseSalary (can have parameter or not)

**Things to consider**: Static or Non-Static Members?

4. Create a main class for building Employee instances
5. Build two Employee instances
6. Give one Employee a raise
7. Display the salaries of both Employees

## Part 2 Encapsulation

## Bank Account - Encapsulation

1. Create Bank Account Class
2. **Attributes:** owner, balance
3. **Behavior:** withdraw, deposit, getter(owner or balance), setter
4. Create constructor
5. Test Bank Account Class
6. Create a Main class that makes a Bank Account instance
7. Withdraw a certain amount using the withdraw method
8. Print out the resulting balance

**Note:** The Bank Account attributes should not be directly accessible

## Part 3 Inheritance

## Reduce Redundant Code with Inheritance

1. Create a **ModArrayList** class
2. Add a **getUsingMod** method that takes in an index and retrieves an item from the list at that index
3. If the index is invalid, then the mod and absolute value operations should be used to make the index positive and mod the index based on the length of the list. If the index is negative turn it to positive.
4. ModArrayList should have all the functionality of **ArrayList**
5. Additional **getUsingMod**
